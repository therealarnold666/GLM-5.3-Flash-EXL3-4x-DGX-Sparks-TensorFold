# Stop the server that ./start.sh (or ./start-tp3.sh) started and remove its containers on every Spark,
# freeing their GPU memory: here (rank 0) and on every configured worker (WORKER, WORKER2), whatever TP is.
# The ranks get STOP_TIMEOUT seconds (default 30) to shut down; requests still running are cut off (it does not drain
# them), so stop.sh says when there are any. Each rank's log is saved first (docker rm deletes it), gzipped, in LOG_DIR
# here (~/.cache/tensorfold-glm53/logs) and ~/.cache/tensorfold-glm53/logs on each worker; the newest LOG_KEEP (10) of
# each rank stay.
# Usage: ./stop.sh      Env: CONTAINER_NAME, PORT, WORKER, WORKER2 (see scripts/config.sh), STOP_TIMEOUT,
#                       LOG_DIR, LOG_KEEP
#   DRY_RUN=1 ./stop.sh   says what it would stop, and on which Spark, and stops nothing
