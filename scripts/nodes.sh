# The NCCL settings of rank r's container (docker -e arguments).
# TP=2: the RoCE link's netdev, RoCE devices (both rails) and GID index, 4 channels. The RoCE all-gathers (patch 0006)
# take the same devices from NCCL_IB_HCA, as TF_ROCE_HCA is not set here (the command is v1.4's); TP>2 sets TF_ROCE_HCA
# per node (nccl_env_n).
# Measured between the Sparks: a decode-sized all-gather 32 us (80 with NCCL's defaults) and a prompt chunk's 32 MB
# 1.9 ms on two rails (3.5 on one). NCCL's other knobs (protocols, buffer sizes, QPs, NCCL_NET=IB and the like) were no
# better, and some of them kept NCCL on one rail.

# TP>2, from the owner's 3-Spark vLLM recipe on this triangle: the bootstrap socket on the network every node shares;
# every RoCE device toward every peer; NCCL_CROSS_NIC=1 and subnet-aware routing (the image's NCCL 2.30.7 has it): each
# cable joins port 0 of one node to port 1 of the next, and NCCL otherwise pairs device index with device index
# (ibv_modify_qp ... Connection timed out); no P2P or SHM transport (one GPU a node). The GID index only when it is the
# same on all of a node's devices; else NCCL picks each device's RoCE v2 IPv4 entry itself.
